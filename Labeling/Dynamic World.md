# Labeling Ontology: Dynamic World
Dynamic World covers labeling for either self-animated objects, or objects that can be manipulated by the bot.

## Label Types
- Segmentation: Highly detailed outlining of both environmental features and objects, with the annotation interior representing the objectâ€™s volume.

- Cuboids: 3 dimensional bounding boxes enclosing objects, with XYZ rotation. May be tracked across multiple frames in video data.

## Labeling Guidelines
### Dynamic Labeling Principles
In Dynamic Labeling workflows, you will label clips involving motion through 3-D scenes. These may involve complex environmental geometry, interaction with objects in the scene and other moving objects such as people.
In this labeling ontology, we will cover the principles used to label each of these various objects.

### Labels
#### Walkable Space
Walkable space refers to the ground floor that ego is either currently walking through in the clip, or appears to be physically able to access during the duration of the clip.
- Do not label floorspace that is occupied by an object above it, such as floorspace directly underneath an object like a desk, table or shelf. This will be considered to be occluded, and *not* walkable space.
- Do label floorspace that is covered in small objects that a human being would be capable of moving, such as garbage bins, bags, loose wires, water bottles, etc...
- Do not label floorspace that is blocked from access by ego in the duration of the clip. For instance, if we can see floor behind a gate or a door with a window, we will not label this as Walkable Space, as ego cannot access this floorspace within the duration of the clip.
